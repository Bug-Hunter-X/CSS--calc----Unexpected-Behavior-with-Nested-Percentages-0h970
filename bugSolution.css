One solution is to avoid using nested percentages within `calc()` that depend on different parent elements. Instead, use absolute units like pixels or ems for a more predictable result.

Another approach is to restructure the CSS to ensure the percentages are relative to the same parent element, thus making the calculation clearer.

```css
.grandparent {
  width: 50%;
}

.parent {
  width: 50%; /* Using a fixed percentage relative to grandparent */
  padding: 10px;
}

.child {
  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Now 100% relative to the parent */
  box-sizing: border-box; /*Consider adding this if padding/border are impacting the width*/
}
```

By using absolute units or restructuring the CSS, the calculation becomes more straightforward and avoids ambiguity in resolving percentage values in nested elements.
